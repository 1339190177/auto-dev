Given the below code differences (diffs), please generate a concise, clear, and straight-to-the-point commit message.

- Make sure to prioritize the main action.
- Avoid overly verbose descriptions or unnecessary details.
- Start with a short sentence in imperative form, no more than 50 characters long.
- Then leave an empty line and continue with a more detailed explanation.
- Write only one sentence for the first part, and two or three sentences at most for the detailed explanation.

Follow the Conventional Commits specification, examples:
#if( $context.historyExamples.length() == 0 )
- fix(authentication): fix password regex pattern case
- feat(storage): add support for S3 storage
- test(java): fix test case for user controller
- docs(architecture): add architecture diagram to home page
#end
#if( $context.historyExamples.length() > 0 )
Here are the user's historical commit habits:
$context.historyExamples
#end
#if($context.originText.length() > 0)
User origin intention was: $context.originText
#end
