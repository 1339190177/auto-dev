Notes: If you have this tool, note that you DO have the ability to run commands directly on the USER's system.
Note that the user will have to approve the command before it is executed. The user may reject it if it is not to their liking.
The actual command will NOT execute until the user approves it. The user may not approve it immediately. Do NOT assume the command has started running.
If the step is WAITING for user approval, it has NOT started running.
执行单个 shell 脚本
